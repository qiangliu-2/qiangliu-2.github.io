# Universities with Three-plus Science Nobelist Doctoral Graduates

The pinnacle of a college education is a doctoral or doctorate degree. The doctorate is an category term for the highest degrees, such as PhD, Dr. Eng, D.Sc, and MD, offered by universities. Therefore, doctoral graduates can be a reliable measure of a university's educational success.

Using a list of Nobel Laureates in **Physics, Chemistry, and Physiology or Medicine** provided by *NobelPrize.org* [(Note 1)](#Notes), the author collected the institutions where Nobelists obtained their doctorate degrees.

As of 2025, there are 617 science Nobelists with doctorate degrees from 169 institutions worldwide. 53 universities have three or more doctoral graduates. Cambridge tops with 45 graduate-Nobelists, while Harvard comes very close with 44.

There are 15 universities with 10 or more Nobelist-graduates, including **Cornell** and Johns Hopkins. The US dominates the top 15 with nine, while Germany, the United Kingdom, and France has three, two, and one, rescpectively.

### Notes
<a name="Notes"></a>
1. Nobelist names up to 2023 is from  https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/facts/lists/affiliations.php.
2. The data was gathered mainly via Google search of Nobelist names using Python script, and then cleaned and checked manually. Over 300 Nobelist names were searched manually, primarily from Wikipedia.
3. Institutions names may have changed over time, and are combined as best as I can. Many names were manually checked primarily via Wikipedia. Note, however, the author is unfamiliar with European universities and thus may have miscounted. Your corrections are truly appreciated!
