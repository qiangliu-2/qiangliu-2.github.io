# Use GitHub as a free web server
    Turn GitHub into your own web server
    Set up your own full-fledged webpage for free

### Four easy steps:
1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) by choosing a user name you like. For example, **qiangliu-2** in my case;
2. Create a new **repository** with the name: **qiangliu-2.github.io** (i.e., your GitHub account name in front of **.github.io**), which will be the URL of your own webpage;
3. Edit and upload an *index.html* into this repository. Wait for a few minutes;
4. Type [qiangliu-2.github.io](https://qiangliu-2.github.io) in any browser, and index.html will show up.

### Features
- Upload folders (or dirs) with HTML files, image files, PDF files, css files, and JS files that can be accessed from HTML files
- Certain pages are generated from **ql_md_template.html** with a *markdown* file as the URL Parameter
- Check out (and download) examples from my [repository](https://github.com/qiangliu-2/qiangliu-2.github.io) and use them for your own purpose.

Notes for working with HTML files:
1. [Test HTML files](https://github.com/qiangliu-sd/folder-sharing-via-web) on your own Windows PC
2. [Edit/View markdown](https://qiangliu-sd.github.io/mdEditView.html) in a browser. Bookmark (or save) the URL, and then open it to create markdown files.
