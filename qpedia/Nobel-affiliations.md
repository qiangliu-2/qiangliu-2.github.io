# Universities with Three Plus Science Nobelist Affiliations

There are differing online lists of universities claiming numbers of Nobel Laureates. Some count graduates and others include even visiting scholars or invited speakers. The most objective list is probably **Nobel Laureates and research affiliations** provided by *NobelPrize.org* [(Note 1)](#Notes), which
> “shows the universities … Nobel Laureates were affiliated with at the time of the Nobel Prize announcement. Only Nobel Laureates in **Physics**, **Chemistry** and **Physiology or Medicine**, … are shown in the list.”

There are 51 universities with three or more Nobel Laureates affiliations. These universities are from the United States (23), the United Kingdom (7), Germany (5), France (4), Sweden (3), Japan and Switzerland (2), and Canada, Denmark, Israel, the Netherlands, and Russia (1) [(Note 4)](#Notes). Only three universities are from Asia, which surprisingly does not include the University of Tokyo.

Harvard tops the list with 30, followed by Stanford and Caltech. The next seven universities are from UC Berkeley (17) to Oxford (11). The US dominates the top 10, while only Cambridge and Oxford are from the UK. 

The next ten universities count from 8 to 6, with **Cornell** at the top. Four universities are from the US.

Ivy League occupies six spots in the top 51 (four in the top 11), a solid showing undoubtedly. Cornell, a school underestimated by parents and students, ranks only behind Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton.

California as a state is in its own league, accoupying No. 2, 3, and 4 spots with seven universities. If it were a country, it would have ranked as No. 2. The UC system is impressive with five in the top 51.

### Notes
<a name="Notes"></a>
1. Data up to 2023 is from  https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/facts/lists/affiliations.php.
2. As of 2025, Laureates with two affiliations are counted as 0.5 for each affiliation.
3. Plus (+) indicates an adjunct position.
4. Names of universities may have changed over time, and are combined as best as I can. Note, however, the author is unfamiliar with European universities and thus may have miscounted. Your corrections are truly appreciated!
